The book portrays the relationship between the British and the Indians in India and 
the tensions that arise when a visiting Englishwoman, 
Adela Quested, accuses a well-respected Indian man, Dr. Aziz, of having attacked her
during an outing. Aziz has many defenders, including the compassionate Cecil Fielding,
the principal of the local college. During the trial Adela hesitates on the witness 
stand and then withdraws the charges. Aziz and Fielding go their separate ways, but two 
years later they have a tentative reunion.
As they ride through the jungles, an outcrop of rocks forces them to 
separate paths, symbolizing the racial politics that caused a breach in their friendship.
